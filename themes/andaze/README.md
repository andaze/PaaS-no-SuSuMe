# Guideline for web development that applies to all projects.

- Avoid zero-based coding as much as possible.
- Know and make extensive use of good libraries available in the world.
- If you are asked to implement or create something, search the Internet for something similar first.
- Avoid hard-coding as much as possible, and try to create a structure and code that can be used in other projects.
